The following repository was created to host class exercise 08 from Game AI lesson in CITM UPC university.

The main objective of this exercise was to create a Unity scene with a Formation Motion behaviour given Target. To do so, we used Unity game engine in its **2021.3.14f1 version** and some free assets from the Unity Assets Store and then we implemented the algorithm using C# Unity scripts.
